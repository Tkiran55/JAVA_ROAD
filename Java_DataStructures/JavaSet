# Java Set Interface
=> The Set interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store a collection of unique elements.

Unlike a List, a Set does not allow duplicates,
and it does not preserve the order of elements (unless you're using TreeSet or LinkedHashSet).

# Common classes that implement Set:
- HashSet - fast and unordered
- TreeSet - sorted set
- LinkedHashSet - ordered by insertion
        Tip: Use a Set when you need to store unique values only.

# Common Set Methods
  Method	    Description
  add()	        Adds an element if it's not already in the set
  remove()	    Removes the element from the set
  contains()	Checks if the set contains the element
  size()	    Returns the number of elements
  clear()	    Removes all elements

#Java HashSet
=> A HashSet is a collection of elements where every element is unique.
=> It is part of the java.util package and implements the Set interface.

    HashSet<Wrapper Class> obj = new HashSet<>();

some methods:
- cars.contains("Mazda"); //Check If an Element Exists
- cars.remove("Volvo"); //remove an element
- cars.clear(); //remove all the element
- cars.size(); //cunt how many unique element are in the set

#Java TreeSet
=> A TreeSet is a collection that stores unique elements in sorted order.
=> It is part of the java.util package and implements the Set interface.

    TreeSet<Wrapper Class> obj = new TreeSet<>();

 Tip: Unlike HashSet, which has no order, TreeSet keeps its elements sorted automatically.

#Java LinkedHashSet
=> A LinkedHashSet is a collection that stores unique elements and remembers the order they were added.
=> It is part of the java.util package and implements the Set interface.

    LinkedHashSet<Wrapper Class> obj = new LinkedHashSet<>();

 Tip: Use LinkedHashSet when you want a set that does not allow duplicates and keeps the original insertion order.
