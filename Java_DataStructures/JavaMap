# Java Map Interface
=> The Map interface is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store key-value pairs.
=> Each key must be unique, but values can be duplicated.

- A Map is useful when you want to associate a key (like a name or ID) with a value (like an age or description).

# Common classes that implement Map:

- HashMap - fast and unordered
- TreeMap - sorted by key
- LinkedHashMap - ordered by insertion

    Tip: Use a Map when you want to associate values with unique keys, like storing user IDs with names.

#Common Map Methods
Method	        Description
put()	        Adds or updates a key-value pair
get()	        Returns the value for a given key
remove()	    Removes the key and its value
containsKey()	Checks if the map contains the key
keySet()	    Returns a set of all keys

#Java HashMap
=> A HashMap stores items in key/value pairs, where each key maps to a specific value.
=> It is part of the java.util package and implements the Map interface.

- Instead of accessing elements by an index (like with ArrayList), you use a key to retrieve its associated value.

 A HashMap can store many different combinations, such as:
 - String keys and Integer values
 - String keys and String values

Example:
 HashMap<String, String> capitalCities = new HashMap<>();

 // Add keys and values (Country, City)
    capitalCities.put("England", "London");
    capitalCities.put("India", "New Dehli");

 // Access a value
    capitalCities.get("England");

 // remove the item
    capitalCities.remove("England");

 // find how many items
    capitalCities.size();
    Note: The size only counts unique keys. If a key is added more than once, only the latest value is kept.

 // For each loop

    Note: Use the keySet() method if you only want the keys, and use the values() method if you only want the values:

    Example
    // Print keys
    for (String i : capitalCities.keySet()) {
      System.out.println(i);
    }

    Example
    // Print values
    for (String i : capitalCities.values()) {
      System.out.println(i);
    }

    Example
    // Print keys and values
    for (String i : capitalCities.keySet()) {
      System.out.println("key: " + i + " value: " + capitalCities.get(i));
    }

#Java TreeMap
=> A TreeMap is a collection that stores key/value pairs in sorted order by key.
=> It is part of the java.util package and implements the Map interface.

 Tip: Unlike HashMap, which does not maintain order, TreeMap keeps its keys sorted.

#Java LinkedHashMap
=> A LinkedHashMap stores keys and values, and keeps them in the same order you put them in.
=> It is part of the java.util package and implements the Map interface.

 Tip: Use LinkedHashMap when you want predictable iteration order (insertion order).
