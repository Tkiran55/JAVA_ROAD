What Is File Handling?

File handling allows Java programs to read data from and write data to files on your computer.
It’s essential for saving user input, configurations, logs, or any persistent data.

****** How to write a file (4 popular options) ******
// FileWriter  = good for small or medium-sized text files.
// BufferWriter = better performance for larger amount of text.
// PrintWriter = best for structured data, like reports or logs.
// FileOutputStream = best for binary files(eg. images, audio)

****** How to read a file (3 popular options) ******
// BufferReader + FileReader = best for reading text files line by line.
// FileInputStream = best for binary files(eg. images, audio)
// RandomAccessFile = best for read/write specific portions of a large files.

1. Why should you always close a file after reading or writing?

Closing a file is important because it frees system resources and ensures that all data is properly saved (flushed) to disk.
If you forget to close it, the program may lose data or lock the file so other programs can’t access it.

🧠 Analogy: It’s like closing a notebook after writing — if you leave it open, the pages might get damaged or lost.

💬 2. What’s the difference between FileWriter and FileReader in Java?
FileWriter is used to write data to a file (output).
FileReader is used to read data from a file (input).
You can think of them as opposite directions — FileWriter puts data into the file, while FileReader takes data out of it.

💬 3. What kind of exception might occur during file handling, and how can we handle it gracefully?
A FileNotFoundException or IOException may occur — for example, if the file doesn’t exist, you lack permissions, or the disk is full.
We handle these by using a try-catch block, allowing the program to continue running and
show a meaningful error message instead of crashing.
