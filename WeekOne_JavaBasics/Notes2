** __Java Operators__ **
=> Java Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables or values

Types
a) Arithmetic operators: *, /, %, +, -
b) Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
c) Relational operators: ==, !=, <=, >=, <, >
d) Logical operators: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
e) Ternary Operator: It is shorthand version of the if-else statement.
    => (condition) ? ifTrue : ifFalse;

** __Decision Making in Java__ **
A programming language uses control statements to control the flow of execution of a program based on certain conditions.

Java provides several control statements to manage program flow, including:

a) conditional statements: if, if-else, if-else if, nested if
b) switch case: for multiple fixed value checks
c) jump statements:  break (exits loop/switch), continue (skip iteration), return (exit method)

** __ Java Loops__ **
=> ConditionalAndLooping in programming language allow a set of instructions to run multiple times based on a condition.
=> There are three types of loops which are:

a) for loop: Used when we know the number of iterations (how many times we want to repeat a task)
    Syntax: for(initialization, condition, increment/decrement){
    .....
    }

b) while loop: Used when we want to check the condition before executing the loop body
    Syntax: initialization;
    while(condition){
    .....
    increment/decrement;
    }

c) do-while loop: USed to ensure that the code block executes at least once before checking the condition.
    Syntax: initialization;
    do{
    .....
    increment/decrement;
    }while(condition);

Note: There is another form of the for loop known as Enhanced for loop (for-each loop).
        This loop is used to iterate over arrays or collections.

** To read input from users we use Scanner class.
    import java.util.Scanner;

** Math class
=> In Java Math class has many methods that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
Example: Math.max(x,y), Math.min(x,y), Math.sqrt(x), Math.abs(x), Math.pow(x,y) etc.

** Random Class
=> In java, random numbers can be generated using either java.util.Random class or Math.random() method.
    import java.util.Random
    Random random = new Random();
    int num = random.nextInt(1,101); // generates random number between 1 to 100.
