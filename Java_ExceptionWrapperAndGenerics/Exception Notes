1. What Is an Exception?

An exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program
— usually caused by something unexpected (like dividing by zero or accessing a missing file).

int x = 10 / 0;  // ⚠️ ArithmeticException: divide by zero
Without handling this, your program will crash.

2. Handling Exceptions with try-catch

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0;
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Cannot divide by zero!");
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues smoothly.");
    }
}

//Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero!
          Program continues smoothly.

Note:
The try block tests the risky code.
The catch block catches the exception and handles it safely.

3. finally Block

You can add a finally block that always runs, whether an exception occurs or not:
It’s typically used to release resources like closing files, network connections, or scanners.

try {
    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
    System.out.println(numbers[5]);
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    System.out.println("Index out of bounds!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This block always executes.");
}

Q. Why is it a bad idea to write an empty catch block (e.g., catch(Exception e){})?

   Because an empty catch block hides the error without handling it.
   This makes debugging difficult since you lose valuable information about what went wrong.
   A better approach is to at least log the error or display a meaningful message to the user.

Q. Why is exception handling better than simply letting a program crash?

   Because exception handling allows your program to detect, respond, and recover from unexpected situations without stopping entirely.
   Instead of crashing, your program can show a clear message or perform a safe fallback action.
   This creates a better user experience and makes the software more robust and professional.
