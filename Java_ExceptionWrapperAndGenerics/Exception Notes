1. What Is an Exception?

An exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program
— usually caused by something unexpected (like dividing by zero or accessing a missing file).

int x = 10 / 0;  // ⚠️ ArithmeticException: divide by zero
Without handling this, your program will crash.

2. Handling Exceptions with try-catch

public class LibraryMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0;
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Cannot divide by zero!");
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues smoothly.");
    }
}

//Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero!
          Program continues smoothly.

Note:
The try block tests the risky code.
The catch block catches the exception and handles it safely.

3. finally Block

You can add a finally block that always runs, whether an exception occurs or not:
It’s typically used to release resources like closing files, network connections, or scanners.

try {
    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
    System.out.println(numbers[5]);
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    System.out.println("Index out of bounds!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This block always executes.");
}

Q. Why is it a bad idea to write an empty catch block (e.g., catch(Exception e){})?

   Because an empty catch block hides the error without handling it.
   This makes debugging difficult since you lose valuable information about what went wrong.
   A better approach is to at least log the error or display a meaningful message to the user.

Q. Why is exception handling better than simply letting a program crash?

   Because exception handling allows your program to detect, respond, and recover from unexpected situations without stopping entirely.
   Instead of crashing, your program can show a clear message or perform a safe fallback action.
   This creates a better user experience and makes the software more robust and professional.

Q. Why is it better to handle exceptions rather than letting the program crash?

   Because unhandled exceptions cause the program to terminate abruptly, leading to a poor user experience and potential data loss.
   By handling exceptions, you can:

   - Show meaningful error messages instead of cryptic stack traces.
   - Recover safely (e.g., retry a connection, skip bad data).
   - Ensure critical cleanup (like closing files or releasing resources).
