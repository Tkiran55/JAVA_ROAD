** __Java Methods__ **
=> A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
=> You can pass data, known as parameters into a method.
=> Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are called functions.

*** Static methods and Instance methods
-> Created using the static keyword and retrieved without creating an object.
-> access only static variables and method.
-> cannot use this keyword within static method. & does not support runtime polymorphism

-> requires an object of its class to be invoked.
-> can access both static and instance members.
-> can use this keyword to refer to the current object. & support runtime polymorphism

** Parameters and Arguments
=> Information can be passed to methods as a parameter. Parameter acts as a variables inside the method.
=> When a parameter is passed to the method, it is called argument.

** Java Return
=> If you want method to return a value, you can use primitive datatypes instead of void.
=> And Use return keyword inside the method.

** Method overloading
=> Method overloading means multiple methods having same method name but with different parameters.
