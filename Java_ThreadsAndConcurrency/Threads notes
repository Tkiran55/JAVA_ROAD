Threads and Concurrency — Making Java Programs Run in Parallel

1. What Are Threads?
A thread is like a mini-program running inside your main program.
Multiple threads can execute simultaneously, allowing your program to do multiple tasks at once — this is called concurrency.

Example use cases:
-Downloading a file while showing a progress bar
-Handling multiple client connections in a server
-Running animations or timers without freezing the UI

Note:
** HOw to create a Thread?
=> option 1: Extend the Thread class (simple)
=> option 2: implement the Runnable interface (better)

What does join() do?

When you call thread.join(), the current thread (e.g., the main thread) waits until the other thread finishes before continuing.
It’s like saying:
“Hey, I’ll wait here until you’re done — then I’ll move on.”

** When to use join()
Use it when:
- You need to wait for a thread to complete before continuing.
- You want to sequence multithreaded operations safely.
- You need deterministic order, e.g. loading data before processing it

Questions:

💬 1. What is the main purpose of using multiple threads in a Java program?

The main purpose is to allow a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously — improving efficiency and responsiveness.
For example, in a chat app, one thread can handle sending messages while another handles receiving them, so the UI doesn’t freeze.

🧠 Analogy: Think of threads as chefs in a kitchen — each can work on a different dish at the same time to serve customers faster.

💬 2. Why can un_synchronized threads cause bugs or inconsistent results?

When multiple threads access and modify the same data at the same time, they can interfere with each other’s operations, causing race conditions.
This leads to unpredictable results, like losing updates or corrupting data.

🧠 Example: Two people withdrawing from the same bank account at once — if not coordinated, the balance might become incorrect.

💬 3. What does the synchronized keyword do, and when would you use it?

The synchronized keyword ensures that only one thread at a time can execute a block of code or method that manipulates shared resources.
You use it when multiple threads share mutable data — to prevent race conditions and maintain data integrity.

🧠 Analogy: It’s like giving one person the only key to a locked room — others must wait their turn before entering.
